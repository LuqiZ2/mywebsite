        <p>Richard McClintock, a <strong> Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney </strong> College, is credited with discovering the source behind the ubiquitous filler text. In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was piqued by consectetur—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin dictionary led McClintock to a passage from <u> De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum f</u> (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C. text from the <br>Roman philosopher Cicero.As an alternative theory, (and because Latin scholars do this sort of thing) <i> someone tracked down a 1914 Latin edition</i> of De Finibus which challenges McClintock's 15th century claims and suggests that the dawn of lorem ipsum was as recent as the 20th century.<br><br><br><brf> The 1914 Loeb Classical Library Edition ran out of room on page 34 for the Latin phrase “dolorem ipsum” (sorrow in itself). Thus, the truncated phrase leaves one page dangling with “do-”, while another begins with the now ubiquitous “lorem ipsum”.</p>

    
        <p>Aldus Corporation, which later merged with Adobe Systems, ushered lorem ipsum into the information age with its desktop publishing software Aldus PageMaker. The program came bundled with lorem ipsum dummy text for laying out page content, and other word processors like Microsoft Word followed suit. More recently the growth of web design has helped proliferate lorem ipsum across the internet as a placeholder for future text—and in some cases the final <a href = "https://www.google.com"  content target="blank" > (this is why we proofread, kids).</a> </p>
